# The-Good-Old-Days.
Testing out Asciimatics with the example script they gave :)



Installation
------------

Asciimatics supports Python versions 2 & 3. For the precise list of tested versions, refer to pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/asciimatics>

To install asciimatics, simply install with `pip` as follows:

    pip install asciimatics

This should install all your dependencies for you.  If you don't use pip or it fails to install
them, you can install the dependencies directly using the packages listed in https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics/blob/master/requirements.txt

Additionally, Windows users (who aren't using `pip`) will need to install `pywin32`
